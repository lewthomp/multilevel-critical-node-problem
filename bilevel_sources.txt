> Each time a new integer solution (x∗, y∗) is found and is going to update the incumbent, a specific “lazy con- straint callback” function is automatically invoked by CPLEX to let the user possibly discard this solution for whatever reason, and possibly add a cut that makes this solution infeasible. In this callback function, we first determine whether the solution is, in fact, bilevel feasible by solving the MILP follower for x 􏰁 x∗, thus obtaining an alternative point (x∗, yˆ) with dT yˆ 􏰁Φ(x∗). If dT y∗ >Φ(x∗), the solution (x∗, y∗) is not bilevel feasible and we cut it using a suitable IC. In case heuristics were enabled and produced an infeasible candidate solution without an associated LP basis, we could just discard it. In any case, point (x∗, yˆ) is passed to a hoc-hoc fea- sibility check procedure that quickly verifies its HPR feasibility (with respect to (2)) and cost, and possibly updates the incumbent. This approach is very useful as it typically produces very good heuristic solutions at the very beginning of the computation.
