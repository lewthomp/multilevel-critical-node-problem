General-purpose bilevel Fischetti algo

BILEVEL-ORIENTED BRANCHING STRATEGY W/ BRANCHING PRIORITIES [1]
-> new integer solution is found (x*,y*)
    1.is the solution bilevel feasible.
        -> if so, solve the follower MILP for y = y*
            - and obtain alternative point (x^,y*) with dy^ = valueFunc
        -> if dy* > valueFunc, sol is not bilevel feasible
            - cut using suitable IC.
    2. new point (x^,y*) is passed to a hoc-hoc feasibility check procedure that
        verifies its HPR feasibility wrt (2) and cost
        -> possibly updates incumbent
